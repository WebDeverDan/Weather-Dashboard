This application is a simple password generator based on user input for number of characters, symbols, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters. The password can be a length of 8 - 128 characters as specified in the project requirements. 

The interface is quite simple, although a few modifications have been made. Initially, it was not intuitive to click the Generate Password button, so instructions have been put into the placeholder box above the button. In addition, the "Generate Password" heade has been centered and element class added in the CSS to accomodate this. 

The code was quite challenging, and the need to comment out most of the lines was imperative to understand and commit to memory how it functions. The initial trigger is the Generate Password button, which calls a prompt of user inputting the desired length (between 8-128 characters). Once they have input their desired length, other prompts to include symbols, numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters. If none were selected, an alert appears reminding the user that atleast one needs to be answered. 

Once the prompts complete, the password will generate based on the length and a random string of characters that is assembled from selected options. The password appears in the placeholder box upon completion.
